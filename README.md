Save Telegram Chat History
--------------------------

###Why this extension?
Perhaps, many of us use and like Telegram messenger for conversations with friends. However, we were a bit disappointed by the absence of any sort of easy-accessible "Save Conversation" feature in the messenger. Therefore, we've written a Chrome extension for it! 

###How It Works
- Install the Chrome extension ["Save Telegram Chat History"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-telegram-chat-histor/kgldnbjoeinkkgpphaaljlfhfdbndfjc?hl=en). You should now see a new icon in the browser.
- Visit https://web.telegram.org.
- Select a peer you want to get history from.
- Click on the icon "Save Telegram Chat History".
- In the popup window click one of the buttons to fetch some messages, then select all text (Ctrl+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C).
- Paste the text into a text editor (Ctrl+V) and save to a local file.
- Congratulations! You are done.


###Features
* Shows your chat history with a Telegram peer as text.

###Requirements
